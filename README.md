If we need to look at DNA sequence in string notation - it probably
is going to be a very long string.

There is some interest in determining if two strings are anagrams to
relate two DNA string notation.

This module contains various implementations of the interface AnagramFinder

When I applied to 5amsolutions, this was one of the assignment.

com.fiveamsolutions.AnagramFinder is the interface and you can see implementations
of this and using Strategy Design Pattern have incorporated tests as well.

5amsolutions liked my solutions - But they said I was overqualified for the job.
